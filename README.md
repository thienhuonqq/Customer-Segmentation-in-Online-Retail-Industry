## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is the Online Retail dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayuv/onlineretail . It contains transactional data for an online retailer based in the UK between 2010 and 2011. The dataset has 541,909 rows and 8 columns.

## Tools Used
Python 3.7, Pandas,  NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Exploring the data
In this section, we explore the dataset to gain insights and understanding of the customers' behavior, demographics, and purchase patterns. We perform exploratory data analysis, such as summary statistics, data visualization, and data cleaning.

## Cohort Analysis
In this section, we perform cohort analysis to analyze customers' behavior over time, identify trends, and understand the impact of marketing campaigns and promotions on customer retention and loyalty.

## RFM Segmentation
In this section, we segment customers based on RFM analysis, which stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value. RFM analysis is a method used to segment customers based on their past purchase behavior, allowing businesses to develop targeted marketing strategies.

## Model Building: Clustering using K-means
In this section, we build a clustering model using K-means to group customers based on their purchase behavior and characteristics. This technique helps identify distinct customer groups and their preferences, enabling businesses to tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.


## Conclusion
Based on our analysis, I found that online retailers can use RFM analysis to segment their customers and develop targeted marketing strategies for each segment to improve customer retention, increase revenue, and boost customer satisfaction. Our recommendations for each segment are as follows:

-  New customers: Offer them discounts or promotions to encourage them to make more purchases, and make sure they have a positive experience to retain them as loyal customers.
-  Lost customers: Win them back by offering personalized promotions or deals, sending them reminder emails, and trying to understand the reason for their inactivity.
-  Best customers: Reward them for their loyalty by offering exclusive deals, personalized communication, and premium services to encourage them to continue their purchasing behavior.
-  At-risk customers: Re-engage them by providing personalized promotions, sending them reminders, and offering them a positive experience to retain them as loyal customers.

In summary, our project demonstrates how RFM analysis can help online retailers better understand their customers and develop targeted marketing strategies to improve their bottom line.
