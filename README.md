Customer Segmentation in Online Retail
This project analyzes customer data for an online retail business to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) analysis.

Data Source
The dataset used in this project is the Online Retail dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains transactional data for an online retailer based in the UK between 2010 and 2011. The dataset has 541,909 rows and 8 columns.

Tools Used
Python 3.7
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Analysis
We conducted RFM analysis to segment customers into four categories based on their purchasing behavior: New customers, Lost customers, Best customers, and At-risk customers. For each segment, we provided RFM interpretations and recommended actions to improve marketing strategies.

Conclusion
Based on our analysis, we found that online retailers can use RFM analysis to segment their customers and develop targeted marketing strategies for each segment to improve customer retention, increase revenue, and boost customer satisfaction. Our recommendations for each segment are as follows:

New customers: Offer them discounts or promotions to encourage them to make more purchases, and make sure they have a positive experience to retain them as loyal customers.
Lost customers: Win them back by offering personalized promotions or deals, sending them reminder emails, and trying to understand the reason for their inactivity.
Best customers: Reward them for their loyalty by offering exclusive deals, personalized communication, and premium services to encourage them to continue their purchasing behavior.
At-risk customers: Re-engage them by providing personalized promotions, sending them reminders, and offering them a positive experience to retain them as loyal customers.
In summary, our project demonstrates how RFM analysis can help online retailers better understand their customers and develop targeted marketing strategies to improve their bottom line.
